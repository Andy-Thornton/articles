=== Liver Pâté

Easy recipe for Liver Pâté. This is the basic way I make it, you can add port, wine, other seasonings as you want. I have even made it with Bushmills Whiskey.

* 1lb of chicken livers
* Half pound of salted butter
* Salt / Pepper to taste

I clean off any gristly bits and wash them, pop them in boiling water for about 5 mins, they tend to be a little pink inside then pop then in a blender with half pound of salted butter and salt / pepper. I used to add a couple of table spoons of port when I made them in the UK. put it in the fridge and its good in a couple of hours. Cheap to make and you get a lot too!

Cover with melted butter when you pop it into the fridge. I know it’s tempting to try it warm, but leave it overnight and go for it the next day.
