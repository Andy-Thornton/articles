Welcome to my blog, I am Andy Thornton and I created this site for a place to write and share my opinions on things that interest me. I am passionate about Open Source and how technology affects our lives and shapes our culture. I am a software engineer working for Red Hat where I get to indulge my passion for Open Source and write free software for a living.

I began my career in London and, like many people in IT at that time (well, old people) , I primarily worked on mainframes with database design. Before moving into consultancy on database design and information security. In the latter half of the nineties I finally settled down with on-line application development and information architecture on the web, which involved far less pulling of cables under floorboards and less risk of electrocution.

Prior to the millennium, my primary focus was on Microsoft technologies (IIS / ASP / VB / .Net / SQL server). However, since then my attention has focused on open source and Linux which has been a passion of mine since the early 90s.

I am an ardent Linux user and in my spare time I try to catch up on my reading, there’s so many technologies out there and love to learn. I like to keep up with the latest trends and I am a constant “tweaker” of both hardware and software and love finding new uses for ‘obsolete’ technology. In Oct 1999 I met my wife and moved from London to Raleigh North Carolina, where I currently live along with a needy poodle and an old beagle who naps all day and doesn't realise she's a dog.
